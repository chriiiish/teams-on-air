# Teams On Air Infrastructure

This is the infrastructure for the **Teams On Air** site.

See the architecture diagram below:
![](../docs/architecture.png)

## Continuous Delivery Setup âœ…

Changes to the infrastructure get deployed straight to production through [Github Actions](https://github.com/chriiiish/funqr/actions)

Check out the deployment plan in `.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure`

## Getting started from scratch
    
1. Install Node
2. Install the AWS CLI
3. Install the AWS CDK
   `$ npm install -g aws-cdk`
4. Open a terminal and run
   ```
    cd infrastructure/
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run test
   ```

At this point you should be able to verify that the code builds and the tests run.


## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`            compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`            watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`             perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`               deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`                 compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`                emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `npm run update`           updates the infrastructure snapshot for testing


## Tests
The infrastructure is unit tested. Please write tests for changes to the infrastructure.

**NOTE: infrastructure will not deploy if tests fail**

To run tests locally: `npm run test`

There is a [snapshot test](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) in place. If you are make changes to the infrastructure you will need to update the snapshot. This tells the test runner you _intended_ to make changes to the infrastructure.

To update the snapshot: `npm run update`


## Test Stacks
To generate a production stack do a regular build and deploy.

To generate a test stack (_branch-name_.on-air.cjl.nz) do two things:
1. Export a `STACK_NAME` variable
   `export STACK_NAME="branch-name"`
2. Specify it as a parameter on the deployment
   `npx cdk deploy --require-approval never --parameters subdomain=$STACK_NAME`

We use test stacks to spin up new instances for pull-requests. E.g. if you create a pull request off the `feature/my-test-branch` branch, then it will create a test environment `my-test-branch.on-air.cjl.nz`
